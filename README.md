# gitea ansible thingy on freebsd
I've just started using Ansible and it's been fun so far.

This most notably uses the hcloud_server module, the pkgng module and the ini_file module,
so it depends on the hcloud python library.

Consider the whole repository to be MIT licensed.

## Note
This is growing beyond a simple gitea setup right now; I'm starting to manage
more of my infrastructure with it, and I don't know how long I'll be comfortable
with keeping this public.
